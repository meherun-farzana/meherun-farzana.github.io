<h2>Experience</h2>

**Research Assistant**  
*2024 - Present*      
Cognitive Agents and Interaction Lab [**(CAIL)**](https://cognistorm.ai/), *University of Dhaka*  
Supervisor: [Dr. Md. Mosaddek Khan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IIb6f_4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)

- Worked on a fine-grained question-grounded semantic evaluation framework for Text-to-SQL, focusing on whether generated SQL preserves the intent of natural-language questions beyond exact match or execution-result matching. [**Preprint here**](/research/#text-to-sql-eval).
  
- Contributed to a [**Business Intelligence Platform**](https://bi.cognistorm.ai/dashboard) that converts natural-language questions on databases into LLM-based SQL, executes the generated queries, and returns the final results through a chat interface.

- Conducted research on bilingual (Bangla–English) semantic grading of written answers for low-resource educational settings, with emphasis on semantic correctness, contexual and concise feedback, and support for typed and handwritten responses. [**Preprint here**](/research/#semantic-grading).

- Developed [**CognifyQ**](https://cognifyq.com/), a web-based assessment platform that ingests educational content from multiple sources, generates teacher-constrained questions, and provides automated evaluation and progress tracking.

**Hydejack** is a boutique [Jekyll] theme for hackers, nerds, and academics, with a focus on personal sites that are meant to impress. 

It includes a blog that is suitable for both prose and technical documentation, a portfolio to showcase your projects, and a resume template that looks amazing on the web and in print.

> Your complete presence on the web — A [blog], [portfolio], and [resume].
{:.lead}


## A Personal Site That Won't Disappear

**Hydejack** is 100% built on Open Source software, and is Open Source itself, save for parts of the PRO version. The PRO version is a one-time payment that gives you the right to use it forever.

Hydejack is all static sites. _HTML_. All you need is a web server — any web server — to have a professional web presence that lasts a lifetime.


## A Free Blogging Theme
**Hydejack** started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.

<!--posts-->


<!-- ## An Impressive Portfolio
A portfolio that's guaranteed to be impressive — no matter what you put into it. -->

<!--projects-->

<!-- 
## A Printable Resume
Get a resume that's consistent across the board — whether it's on the web, mobile, print, or [PDF](/assets/Resume.pdf).

## Just Markdown
Write all content with Markdown. __Hydejack__ gives you [additional CSS classes](docs/writing.md) to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.


## Just Markup
**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a _plain old web page_ at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

![w3m Screenshot](/assets/img/blog/w3m.png){:.tail width="1920" height="1260" loading="lazy"}

The Hydejack blog, as seen by the text browser `w3m`.
{:.figcaption}


## Syntax Highlighting
**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge]. -->
<!-- 
```html
<!-- file: `_includes/my-body.html` -->
<!-- <script type="module">
  document.querySelector("hy-push-state").addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", () => {
    const supportsCodeHighlights = false; // TBD!!
  });
</script> -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Code blocks can have a filename and a caption.
{:.figcaption} -->


<!-- ## Beautiful Math
They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][math] it's guaranteed to also look beautiful:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \phi(x,y) &= \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right) \\[2em]
            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j)            \\[2em]
            &= (x_1, \ldots, x_n)
               \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
                 \phi(e_1, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
                 \vdots          & \ddots & \vdots         \\
                 \phi(e_n, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
               \end{array}\right)
               \left(\begin{array}{c}
                 y_1    \\
                 \vdots \\
                 y_n
               \end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Hydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.
